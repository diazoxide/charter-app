//! What it means to start a chat on a harness profile.
//!
//! **One home, in the core**, because four callers reach it — the picker, a relaunch's
//! reopen, a handoff, and the CLI — and a gate each of them has to remember is a gate one of
//! them will not. The thing it would let through is a command out of a file a chat can
//! write, running with no prompt between the click and the exec.
//!
//! The order is the whole of it, and every step is a refusal that already has its own
//! reasons recorded elsewhere:
//!
//! 1. the profile is one this machine declares — a chat whose profile is gone is skipped by
//!    NAME and never given another (ADR 0022);
//! 2. the persona is one this plane has;
//! 3. the plane's guest layer reaches the directory the chat starts in, or gets written
//!    there — a git root of its own cuts the walk-up off, and `enabledPlugins` in that
//!    directory is what the next step's probe reads (ADR 0027, closed by M1.x);
//! 4. [`crate::wiring::wired_or_refusal`] — the kind is startable, the file is not one git
//!    would carry, the operator approved the command, and the folder is wired or gets wired;
//! 5. only then are the arguments and the environment built.
//!
//! **The harness comes from the DECLARED kind**, never from the program's name.
//! [`crate::harness::Harness::of_command`] cannot tell a shell from a harness charter has
//! not measured, and a profile's command is commonly a wrapper script — ADR 0022 says so in
//! as many words — so inferring from it hands the board `None`, which is the narrowest rule
//! there is, and the chat silently loses the session id that makes it resumable.
