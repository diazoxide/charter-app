//! Harness profiles: which program a chat runs, with what environment, on THIS machine.
//!
//! A port of `charter/profiles.py`, decided by [ADR 0022]. Every refusal sentence charter
//! WRITES is that file's, word for word, because both implementations read one plane and an
//! operator must not get two different answers about their own file.
//!
//! **Three details are quoted from somewhere else and do not match**, found in review and
//! recorded here rather than left to be discovered: the TOML parser's message for a
//! `charter.local.toml` that will not parse, the operating system's message for one that
//! cannot be read, and the same for `git`. Those are `toml_edit`'s and Rust's words against
//! `tomllib`'s and CPython's. The sentence AROUND them is identical, which is what a
//! differential scenario pins — it masks the parenthesised detail and compares the rest —
//! and what an operator acts on is the sentence and the fix, not the parser's diagnostic.
//!
//! **Why a refusal and not a warning.** A profile's `command` runs on a click. Between
//! pressing "New chat" and the exec there is no harness permission prompt, no tool call a
//! guard could deny, nothing that shows a person the words about to be run. Everything here
//! that looks like suspicion of the operator's own file is that sentence, applied.
//!
//! **Profiles are read only from `charter.local.toml`**, beside `charter.toml` and out of
//! git: a command in the committed file could be changed by a merged pull request and then
//! run on every machine that pulls it. A `[harness.<name>]` table in `charter.toml` is
//! refused with a pointer to the local file.
//!
//! Nothing here runs a subprocess except [`ignore_check`], which runs one `git status` and
//! only where a person asked.
