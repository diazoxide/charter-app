//! The commands an extension adds to the `charter` command line, under its own id
//! (charter-app#342, ADR 0053).
//!
//! **`charter <extension id> <command> …`, and never a word of charter's own.** A command is
//! reached only through the extension's id, so an extension can add words below its own name
//! and none beside charter's. An id that *is* one of charter's own command words is refused when
//! the manifest is read ([`CORE_WORDS`]), so it is refused at install, at approval and at every
//! later read, and no extension can stand where a core command stands.
//!
//! **A command says whether it writes.** One that does is listed in the approval prompt, and is
//! held to the plane paths the extension declares it writes (`super::writes`): it is handed them
//! resolved, and a change outside them is reported after it ran — detected, not prevented, as
//! for an action (ADR 0041). One that says it only reads is handed no path at all, and any change
//! to the plane while it ran is reported. A chat's `charter <id> <command>` is judged by the same
//! tool guard as any `charter` call, and one that writes is never waved through by a persona's
//! grant ([`crate::personagate`]).
