/// produce one. And because the app mints at most one live ticket per chat and forgets it the
/// moment it is spent or the deadline passes, one approved `charter handoff` opens at most one
/// chat.
///
/// **What it does not buy, plainly.** It does not authenticate the *approval*. A process
/// already inside the chat's own process tree has the socket path and the chat number in its
/// environment, so it can run this same two-line exchange — or simply exec `charter handoff`
/// itself, which is the same command the operator's prompt stands in front of. charter cannot
/// tell that process from the invocation the operator approved, because the consent lives in
/// the harness's permission prompt and nothing inside the process tree witnesses it: no hook
/// fires between the operator's yes and the command running, and anything a hook could say

/// opens a handed-off chat anywhere but on a strip, and why the stamp is not optional.
