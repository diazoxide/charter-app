//! How a hook process reaches the app: one line on a unix socket the app owns.
//!
//! A hook runs inside the chat's own process tree, so everything it needs is already in its
//! environment — the socket to write to and the chat it belongs to. It looks nothing up, reads
//! no plane and opens no file, which is what keeps it inside the spec's 50 ms.
//!
//! **It can never break a turn.** Every failure here is silent and fast: no app listening, a
//! socket that has gone, a payload that will not parse. A harness whose turn fails because
//! charter wanted to draw a spinner is worse than a spinner that is wrong.
