//! What was open when the app last quit, so the next launch can put it back.
//!
//! This is the app's own file, at `.charter/app/reopen.json` in the plane. It is not the
//! tmux frame's `.charter/frame/reopen.json` — that one belongs to the frame this app
//! replaces, and the app never touches it (`docs/plane-format.md`).
//!
//! The file is written by a process that may have been killed halfway, edited by hand, or
//! left behind by an older version, so reading is a conversion: a record of another
//! version, a file that is not JSON, and a `resume` that is not a session id all read as
//! "nothing to put back" rather than as an error a launch would have to handle.
//!
//! **What that does and does not cover.** `resume` is held to a shape because it is the one
//! field charter itself puts on a command line, where a leading `-` would be a flag the
//! operator never typed. `program`, `args` and `cwd` are **not** checked: they say what to
//! run, and there is no shape that separates a harness the operator installed from anything
//! else they might run. So this file is, for whoever can write it, a way to have a command
//! run at every later launch — behind one question that names how many chats and in which
//! projects (charter-app#250), and never what they run.
//!
//! **It is not true that a gitignored `.charter/` keeps this out of a clone.** An ignore rule
//! does not apply to a tracked path: `git add -f` commits a symlink — or a file far larger
//! than charter will read — and a fresh clone materialises it. (A FIFO is the one poison git
//! cannot carry; it needs a local writer.) That assumption is what left the record reachable through a link, so the
//! path is guarded now (`no_link_on_the_way`) rather than argued about. What remains true is
//! that anyone who can *write* this file could already write a shell profile — it is not a
//! way in, it is a way to *survive*: one write buys every launch after it, in another
//! process, with none of charter's guards in the path.
