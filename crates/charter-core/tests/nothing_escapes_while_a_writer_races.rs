//! The record, with a thread planting a link at it while charter reads and writes it.
//!
//! `nothing_escapes.rs` asks whether a link that is **already there** is refused. This asks
//! the other half, which charter ADR 0028 measured and decided: a link planted in the window
//! between the gate answering and the caller opening. Before `contain::open_no_link` and
//! `contain::create_no_link`, that window put the whole record outside the plane 7600 times
//! per 20,000 writes, and gave a launch a command line from outside the plane 1881 times per
//! 20,000 reads. Both are zero now, and both were watched failing at 4,000 rounds before
//! they were trusted: 423 planted command lines taken, and the record captured outside.
//!
//! **This is a net, not the bite.** The tests that go red the instant `O_NOFOLLOW` is dropped
//! are in `contain`'s own module, driving the open half without the walk in front of it —
//! through the public pair the walk answers first, so a planted link is refused either way
//! and a test on the pair alone would notice nothing. What this file adds is the whole path,
//! end to end, with a real racer: a guard can be right while the call site that needed it is
//! missing, which is the failure `nothing_escapes.rs` was written for.
//!
//! It is not timing-dependent in the direction that matters. With the flag the count is zero
//! every time rather than usually zero, so a racer that never gets a turn cannot make this
//! pass by luck — it can only make it say less.
