//! The memory commands: `charter recall`, `charter workspace remember|note|recall|forget|
//! optimize` and `charter persona remember|recall|forget|dedupe|optimize|log` —
//! `charter/commands.py:cmd_recall`,
//! `commands_workspace.py` and `commands_persona.py`, with their output byte for byte.
//!
//! **What an agent reads is the contract.** `charter recall` runs at session start and on
//! demand, and whatever consumes it parses these exact lines; the recorded scenarios
//! (`recall-*`, ADR 0046) hold them to Python's.
//!
//! Two things this binary does not do, and says so where a command meets them:
//!
//! - **Commit memory reactively.** A plane whose `[memory] share` is `commit` or `push` had
//!   the Python charter commit each memory as it was written. Here a memory travels with the
//!   plane's next save: the app's auto-save, or, outside the app, `charter save` (ADR 0051).
//! - **Follow a slug out of the store.** `workspace forget` takes one path segment. charter's
//!   own resolver accepts more than that; this does not, and that is deliberate.
