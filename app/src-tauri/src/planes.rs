//! Every plane this process holds open, and what it holds for each one.
//!
//! **The app used to hold exactly one.** `Hooks`, `Chats` and the plane's root were managed
//! as process-wide singletons, every command took `State<'_, Hooks>` or `State<'_, Chats>`,
//! and which plane those belonged to was whatever directory the process was launched from.
//! A project IS a plane, so an app that can only hold one can only ever show one project.
//!
//! What replaces it is a registry keyed by the plane's root. Nothing per-plane is managed by
//! Tauri any more, so there is no `State<'_, Chats>` to reach for: the only way to a board or
//! a chat is [`Planes::held`], and that takes the [`PlaneId`] the caller is acting for. A
//! command that forgets which plane it means does not compile.
//!
//! **A session number means nothing without its plane.** Each plane numbers its own chats
//! from one, and that number is what charter hands the chat as `CHARTER_SESSION_ID` — the
//! rung `.charter/sessions/<sid>.workspace` is keyed on, inside that plane. Numbering across
//! planes instead would make one plane's chat numbers depend on which other planes the
//! process happened to be holding, and put that dependency on disk. So the identity of a chat
//! is the pair, and every command that names a session names its plane beside it.
