//! The worktree verbs, as the window can reach them.
//!
//! Thin by design: every decision — what may be removed, what may be merged, which paths are
//! this workspace's — lives in `charter_core::worktree`, and this layer converts. A rule
//! implemented here as well would be a second rule, and the two would drift.
//!
//! **A refusal crosses unchanged.** The core's refusals are sentences that name the repair,
//! and the whole point of putting these verbs in the window is that the operator reads the
//! same sentence there as in a terminal. So `Refusal` is converted with `to_string()` and
//! nothing else: no rewording, no "failed to remove worktree", no error code the UI would
//! then have to translate back into English.
