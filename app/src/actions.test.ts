/**
 * The palette at the scale the limits are written for.
 *
 * charter-app#48 asked whether fifty chats' worth of browsable rows bury the verb the
 * operator typed for, and asked for it to be MEASURED before anything was changed. It does,
 * and these are the measurements, kept as assertions so the answer cannot quietly rot.
 *
 * What was measured, on the catalogue built below — fifty tabs, six workspaces, two chats in
 * the queue, a worktree in front:
 *
 * | typed | `Remove this chat's worktree` was | is now |
 * |-------|-----------------------------------|--------|
 * | `re`  | 41st of 41                        | 2nd    |
 * | `r`   | 86th of 87                        | 12th   |
 *
 * **And the frame's own remedy would not have moved either number.** The tmux frame kept
 * workspaces out of its browsable list; the rows ahead of the verb under `re` are tabs and
 * close-tab rows almost to the last one, and no version of this list has ever left the tabs
 * out. That is why this is ranking and not filtering.
 *
 * ## What charter-app#174 cost this, measured — and what was done about it
 *
 * The explorer's rows needed a row per piece to have a menu at all, so the shape below grew
 * ten clones with five pieces each and the plane's personas — the limits ADR 0026 writes for.
 * That is 183 rows to **291**, and the first cut of it moved `Remove this chat's worktree`
 * down the list:
 *
 * | typed | before #174 | #174, first cut | #174 as merged |
 * |-------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
 * | `re`  | 4th of 62   | 54th of 164     | **4th of 164** |
 * | `r`   | 19th of 125 | 77th of 233     | **7th of 233** |
 * | `rem` | 1st of 7    | 1st of 57       | 1st of 57      |
 *
 * **The fifty rows that got in the way were all worktree rows, and that made it a different
 * defect from #48 with the same shape on screen.** #48 was forty CHAT NAMES containing `re`;
 * these are fifty merges of named worktrees, every one of them charter's own vocabulary, so
 * #48's rule could not see them — they pass `byItsWords` exactly as the target does. From the
 * operator's seat that distinction buys nothing: the row he wanted was 54th either way.
 *
 * So `narrow` gained a second rule inside that group — `aboutWhatIsInFront`, the colon in the
 * id — and the row is back where it was. The `r` column improves on the BEFORE number too
 * (19th to 7th), because the same rule lifts it above `Delete workspace <name>` and `Switch
 * to project <name>`, which are rows about things the operator is not looking at either.
 * Asserted below as a property — the same rank with the pieces and without — so the next row
 * added about something else has to look at it.
