/**
 * **The discriminator**, and the reason it is written out at length rather than folded into

 *
 * The scenario run cannot open a context menu: a WebDriver right-click opens nothing on
 * webkit 605.1.15 (macOS) or on WebKitGTK 605.1.15 (Linux) — `e2e/specs/workspace-lifecycle`
 * records the runs. Two engines behaving identically under one driver points at the driver,
 * but "points at" is not a measurement, and the alternative — that charter's own wiring
 * swallows the event — would be a bug the operator meets a minute after installing.
 *
 * So the question is asked where there is **no WebDriver anywhere in the picture**: one
 * `MouseEvent`, constructed and dispatched on a real workspace tab of the real `App`, with
 * `useNoBrowserMenu` mounted — which is the only thing charter has that could prevent it.
 *
 * What this stands guard over is the ordering `Menus.tsx` documents. React 19 attaches its
 * delegated listeners to the root container, BELOW `window`, so Radix's composed
 * `onContextMenu` runs before the window-level suppressor and opens the menu. A capturing
 * suppressor would reverse that: `composeEventHandlers` skips Radix's own handler once the
 * event is `defaultPrevented`, so every context menu in the app would stop opening —
 * silently, because nothing throws and the browser menu would still be gone.
