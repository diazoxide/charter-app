 * them on, which is why a terminal is a Tab stop you arrive at and cannot Tab out of.
 *
 * **Ctrl+Tab is the platforms' own answer to exactly that**, a control that keeps Tab for
 * itself: GTK moves the focus out of a text view with it, as Windows does out of a multi-line
 * box and AppKit out of a field editor that took Tab. And it takes nothing from the chat, by
 * the rule `docs/ui-primitives.md` holds every claimed key to: xterm.js 6.0.0's
 * `evaluateKeyboardEvent` ignores Ctrl on key code 9 and sends `\t` for Ctrl+Tab and `ESC [ Z`
 * for Ctrl+Shift+Tab — the same bytes Tab and Shift+Tab already send. A shell cannot tell them
 * apart, so there is nothing to hand back.
 *
 * On the capture phase of the pane, so it runs before xterm's own listener on its textarea,
 * and stops the event there. WebKit has no default action for Ctrl+Tab (its tab handler
 * returns early on Ctrl), so where the keyboard goes is decided here, along the same sequence
 * Tab walks (`tabSequence.ts`).
