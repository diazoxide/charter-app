/**
 * Making a workspace and deleting one, from the window.
 *
 * **The delete is what these tests are for.** `charter workspace remove` refuses over work
 * that removing the workspace would discard (`wscmd::work_at_risk`), and that guard runs
 * inside the command. So what has to be true of the window is narrow and checkable:
 *
 * - the only thing it ever calls is `workspace_remove`;
 * - the first press passes `force: false`, always;
 * - a refusal is shown in the core's own words, and **nothing is deleted**;
 * - forcing is a second press on a button that did not exist before the refusal, and it names
 *   what it is about to discard.
 *
 * Against the whole app rather than the dialog alone, because the claim is about the path from
 * a right-click on a strip to an IPC call, and a test of the dialog in isolation would leave
 * every step of that path unasserted.
