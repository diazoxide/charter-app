 * A radio group's values are strings and one of them has to mean nothing. The empty string is

/**
 * What a new chat asks before anything runs.
 *
 * **No harness starts until somebody picks a profile** (ADR 0022). It shows even when one
 * profile is available, because skipping it would bring back the harness nobody picked on a
 * one-harness machine, and one profile costs one Enter. Escape closes it having started
 * nothing — no harness ran, and no identity was recorded.
 *
 * A dialog rather than a pane that draws itself: the tmux frame put the selector in the
 * chat's own pane because tmux had already made the pane, and here there is no chat yet.
 * Nothing is opened until a row is picked, so cancelling leaves nothing to tear down.
 *
 * A profile whose command charter has not recorded running shows that command and asks. The
 * file is gitignored, so an edit to it leaves no diff for a reviewer to catch, and nothing
 * stops a chat editing plane config — which is why the ask is about the words that are
 * about to run and not about the profile's name.
 *
 * **The footer checkbox is asked here and nowhere else** (ADR 0029). Inside a pane
 * charter prints an empty line where its own footer would go, because the app's panels
 * already draw the plane — and this is where an operator says "not this chat". The choice is
 * between charter's footer and nothing: `charter statusline` IS Claude Code's `statusLine`
 * command, so a blank line there leaves the harness with no status line at all.
 *
 * It is asked at the start rather than offered as a switch on a running pane because that
 * command inherits the environment its harness was exec'd with: a toggle on a live chat would
 * appear to work and would not.
 *
 * **The Name field is optional** (charter-app#254). Empty is the default — the persona and the
 * chat's number, `steward 3` — and a name typed here is what the tab says instead. It is
 * charter's label for the chat, not the harness's own name, and the core is what refuses one
 * it will not draw: its refusal comes back into this dialog, before anything has started.
 *
 * **Every control here is a Radix primitive** (`docs/ui-primitives.md`). It was hand-rolled
 * markup, and the hand-rolling is what broke it: five spans in one `<label>` with no rule to
 * lay them out ran together into `claudeclaudeclaudebuilt-indefault`, and the accessible name
 * of every row was that same run of words. A row's name is now its name, the rest of the row
 * describes it, and the layout is a grid rather than whatever the spans fell into.
 *
 * **Every radio row picks itself on focus, and that is not decoration.** A radio group's pick
 * follows the keyboard — an arrow moves to the next row AND chooses it, which is what the
 * native inputs here did for nothing. Radix means to do it too: `RadioGroupItem` selects on
 * focus while an arrow key is down, and it learns that an arrow key is down from a `keydown`
 * listener it adds to `document`. It never learns it here, and the reason is not this app's.
 * React attaches its delegated listeners to the root container and to each portal container,
 * both of which are BELOW `document`, so one arrow press runs `document` capture, then React's
 * handler — which moves the focus — and only then `document` bubble, where Radix would have
 * set its flag. Measured rather than assumed: the three listeners were logged in that order,
 * the focus moved to the next row, and `onValueChange` was never called. Nothing about jsdom
 * causes it; the same nesting holds in the webview. Focus can only arrive at a row here by
 * arrow or by pointer — a roving tabindex is entered at the row that is already checked, so
 * tabbing in picks what was already picked — which makes "focused" and "picked" the same thing
 * for this control rather than a second behaviour. "moves between harnesses with the arrow
 * keys" goes red the moment an `onFocus` comes off a row.
