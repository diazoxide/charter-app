/**
 * Every action the window can do, in one list.
 *
 * **The palette invents no command list of its own, and neither does the bar.** The tmux
 * frame learned this the expensive way: `charter/frame/palette.py` builds its rows out of
 * `frame/actions.py`'s offers and nothing else, because the menu it replaced had grown a
 * second answer to "how do I do a thing" and the two answers drifted. Here the same rule is
 * kept by making :func:`catalogue` the only place an action is written down — the header's
 * buttons are a view of it, filtered to the few ids that have earned a permanent place on
 * the bar, and the palette is a view of all of it. Delete a row here and the button goes
 * with it, which is what a test asserts.
 *
 * **An offer is DATA, not a closure.** What a row does is a `Does` — a value naming the verb
 * and what it is about — and the window turns that into work through :func:`perform`, in an
 * event handler. Two things fall out of that. The catalogue is a pure function of the window
 * as it stands, so the whole of it can be asserted on without a window; and no row can be
 * holding a stale copy of the arrangement it was built from, because a row holds no copy of
 * anything.
 *
 * **An action that cannot run right now is listed WITH ITS REASON.** It is never dropped: an
 * operator cannot ask about an option they cannot see. `available` and `reason` are two
 * fields rather than one derived from the other, so a row that says the wrong thing is a
 * defect here and not an ambiguity in the surface drawing it.
 *
 * **A refusal is a value, not a throw.** `perform` answers a `Ran`, so a refusal the core
 * gave travels to the operator as the core's own sentence rather than as whatever a `catch`
 * decided to say about it.

 * the verb are the TABS, which the frame kept, so dropping the workspaces would not have
